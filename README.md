If you launch this script from your terminal, you will be able to preview the terminal theme as well.

Features: <br />
-Lets you preview your WAL theme<br />
-Lets you use small, centered wallpapers <br />
-Generates a background color for Nitrogen which matches the image (useful for images smaller than the screen) <br />
